<h3>Tables: Interacting with Tables</h3>

Search results from the Catalog Search Tool (or the tool called Atlas)
return results in an interactive table. This section describes
features of this interactive table.<P>

<h3><A name="header">Header: the top of the table</A></h3>

At the top of the table, there may be several symbols, for example:<br> <img
src="img/tablehead.png"><br> which we now describe.<P>

The first 100 rows of the search results are displayed in the table.
In the example, there are 589 sources that were retrieved as part of
the search.  The black arrows plus the page number allow you to
navigate among these 'pages' of 100 sources each.  Note that the
entire set of results (not just the 100 rows you are currently
viewing) can be sorted alphabetically by clicking on any column's
name. <P>

Going from left to right along the top of the catalog tab, the next
icon represents a filter: <img src="img/filter.png">  Filters are
complex and powerful enough that they are covered in a <a
href="#filters">separate section below</A>.<P>


The next icon is <img src="img/texttable.png"> -- clicking on this
changes the table display into a text display. The icon then changes
to <img src="img/table.png"> -- click this again to return to the
default table view.<P>

The next icon is <img src="img/savetable.png"> which is "Save" -- this
is how you may save the whole catalog to your own local disk. It will
save it as an <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table file</A>, which is basically ASCII text
with headers explaining the type of data in  each column, separated by
vertical bars.  By default, the file is called "GatorQuery.tbl".
<strong>Note that</strong> it will save your whole catalog if you save
without filtering. If you filter, the header of the file will still
say that all the rows are included, but only the filtered-down rows
are saved.<P>


The next to last option on the top of the catalog tab is this: <img
src="img/tableoptions.png">.  Clicking on this icon brings up options
for the table, e.g., how many rows are displayed per page, and which
columns are shown. By default, all columns are shown. The default page
size is 100 rows.  Note that expanding the page size to numbers much
greater than 100 may result in a substantial performance degradation
(e.g., your browser will appear to freeze or not appear to be doing
anything while it manages and renders the large table).  <P>

Finally, this is the last option on the top of the catalog tab: <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png">. Clicking on this expands the catalog
window pane to take up the entire browser window. To return to the
prior view, click on "Close" in the upper left.<P>



<h3><A name="columns">Columns</A></h3>

Depending on what you did to display a table, the columns that are
shown may be in easily-human-readable form, or may reflect column
names used within the individual catalog. Please consult the detailed
documentation associated with your specific archive if the headers are
not clear to you.<P>

There may be flexibility to display or hide columns, as described in the
<a href="#header">headers section above</A>.<P>

Clicking on the column names sorts the table by that column; clicking
once sorts in ascending order, clicking a second time sorts in
descending order, and clicking a third time returns the table to the
original order.  Small arrows appear next to the column names to
remind you if the column is sorted in ascending or descending order.



<h3><A name="filters">Filters</A> -- Filtering the table</h3>


Filters are a <em>very</em> powerful way of exploring the table full
of search results.  Click on this icon <img src="img/filter.png"> in
order to start the process of adding filters. A text entry box appears
above each of the current catalog columns, with a small version of the
filter icon corresponding to that row on the far left. You can type
operators and values in these boxes -- hit return after typing or
click in another box to implement the filter. For fields with a
limited set of choices, instead of a text entry box, a filter icon
will appear; click on it to select from the available choices. <P>

<strong>Example 1:</strong> Atlas search results are a list of images
meeting your search criteria. They may not all be science images --
some may be errors or coverage maps. To just view the science images,
filter down to just leave the science images. Click on the filter
icon, and type "science" in the box above the corresponding columns.
The table is filtered down to leave just the science images.<P>

<strong>Example 2:</strong> From a catalog, show only those sources
with declination above a certain value (say, 31 degrees), type "&gt;
31" in the box above the "dec" column. Or, if you have retrieved a
WISE catalog and would like to only view the objects with a W1 (3.4
micron) profile-fitted magnitude less than 6 magnitudes, above the
'w1mpro' column, type "&lt; 6" in the form.  <P>

After you impose a filter, then the number of rows in the catalog is
restricted according to the rules you have specified, and the
"filters" icon on the top right of the catalog pane has changed to
remind you that there has been a filter applied, in this case just one
filter: <img src="img/filtersapplied.png">. To clear the filters, click on
the cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>

Note that the filters are logically "AND"ed together -- it will impose
this AND that AND this other restriction. You can relatively easily
restrict things such that no data are left; if that is the case, you
will get "There are no data to display." You can then cancel all the
filters at once via the cancel filters icon (<img
src="img/cancelfilters.png">), or remove them individually by hand by
editing the filter boxes at the top of each column, just as you did to
impose the filters. <P>

The available logical operators are :
<UL>
<LI> =  which means 'equal to' (exactly!), e.g., the parameter on
which I am querying (the column headers as shown) is exactly equal to
this value I am specifying.
<LI> &gt; which means 'greater than'
<LI> &lt; which mean 'less than'
<LI> != which means 'not equal to' (exactly!)
<LI> &gt;= which means 'greater than or equal to'
<LI> &lt;= which means 'less than or equal to'
<LI> IN which means 'included within this list', e.g., the
parameter  on which you are querying (such as "Bandpass") is included
within the list you are specifying (if the column filter is free-form
text, type "value1,value2" and it will give you rows that have value1
or value2).
<LI> LIKE which means 'resembles the text that is entered', e.g., the text
resembles the text that you type in the box.
</UL>
