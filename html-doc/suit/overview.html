<h3>IRSA Viewer: Overview</h3>

The IRSA Viewer allows image visualization and catalog overlays, from
off your local disk, the web, and/or other IRSA services. It is a
standalone version of the image viewer portion of several other
archives housed at IPAC, such as <a
href="http://sha.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Spitzer/SHA/"
target="_blank">SHA</A>, <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/wise/"
target="_blank">WISE</A>, and <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/planck/"
target="_blank">Planck</A>. <P>

You can initiate the IRSA Viewer by loading the tool directly, or by
clicking on a link that looks like this: <img
src="img/viewerlaunch.png">. If the you have loaded the tool directly,
the first time you see the IRSA Viewer, it does not have an image
pre-loaded; if you have clicked the icon to launch it, the first time
you see the IRSA Viewer, it already has an image
loaded.

Besides the online help (also available as a pdf), note that there are
also IRSA Viewer Tool and Catalog Search Tool video tutorials,
including  quick start and longer AAS-demo style overviews, available
at the <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel</A>.  Also see the IRSA Viewer
playlist (which collects all the IRSA Viewer tutorials together), as
well as the playlist of tutorials relevant for more than one
archive.<P>

<h3><A NAME="terminology">Terminology</A></h3>

This is the <b>image toolbox</b>:<br>
<img src="img/toolbox.png" width="100%"><br>
In the IRSA Viewer, this image toolbox is always present as a row of
tools just under the IRSA banner.<P>

The words in blue rectangles under the toolbox are 'tabs.'<br>
<img src="img/bluetabs.png"><P>

Regardless of what tool you use, your browser window is divided into
"panes", like "window panes." The contents of the panes depends on
what you are doing with the tool, but could include an image pane, a
catalog pane, and a plot pane.  You can expand any of the window panes
by clicking on the expand icon: <img src="img/expand-24x24.png"> <p>

When you add things to the image as seen in your browser, you are
adding 'layers' to your image. You can turn the various layers off and
on via the layers icon <img src="img/layers.png"> in the image toolbox
-- the circled number tells you how many layers are displayed for the
image you have shown or selected.<P>



<h3><A NAME="visualization">Visualization Overview</A></h3>

When you load in images from your local disk, from the web, or from
the IRSA archives, you are interacting with the actual FITS file, and
as such, you can perform several manipulations such as changing the
stretch and color table, overlay things such as coordinates and
catalogs, and interact with the layers you have placed over the image,
such as identifying which source in the image corresponds to which row
in the catalog. You can also make plots of columns in the catalogs you
have loaded.<P>

See <a href="visualization.html">the Visualization section</A> for more
on visualization  and the <a href="catalogs.html">the Catalogs
section</A> for more on catalogs.<P>


<h3><a name="login">User Login</A></h3>

In the far upper right, there is a link to log in.  IRSA Viewer can
remember you when you return.  See the <a href="user.html">user
registration section</A> for more information.  <P>
