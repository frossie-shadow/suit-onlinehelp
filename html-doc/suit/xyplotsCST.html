<h3>X-Y Plots</h3>

Certain implementations of the Abbreviated IRSA Viewer either display
results in an x-y plot format, or allow users to make such a plot.
These plots are interactive. This section describes features of this
x-y plotting service.<P>

<h3><a name="xyplots">Interacting with X-Y plots</A></h3>

Depending on how the xy plot is created, it most likely comes up with
RA and Dec displayed first. Note  RA increases to
the left. <P>

One of the most powerful aspects of the x-y plots is its
interactivity. If you click on a source in the plot, it is highlighted
in other portions of the display - perhaps overplotted on an image or
highlighted in a catalog.<P>

You can click and drag to zoom in the plot. This is called "rubber
band zoom." You can also use this feature to filter the catalog that
is plotted -- this is another aspect of the <a
href="tablesCST.html#filters">table filtering</A> covered in another
section.<P>

You can change what is plotted by clicking on the gears icon: <img
src="img/xyplotoptions.png">. See <a href="#catalogs">plotting
catalogs</A> below.<P>




<h3><a name="catalogs">Plotting catalogs</A></h3>

The plotting tool, by default, starts with RA and Dec plotted.  For
large catalogs, the plot is binned -- more points are encompassed in a
black tile and fewer points are encompassed in a white tile. For small
catalogs, each individual point is shown as a blue dot.<P>

In either case, letting your mouse hover over a point tells you the
values of the point under your cursor, and (if binned) how many points
are represented:<br> <img src="img/morethanonepoint.png"><P>


To change what is plotted, click on the gears icon in the upper right
of the plot window pane: <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png">.
Configuration options then appear in a pop-up. You can choose a single
column to plot against another column -- either start typing a column
name into the X and Y boxes, and it will help provide you viable
options from the column headings, or click on the "Cols" link to bring
up a pop-up with all the columns listed. NOTE THAT you must type in
the column name <em>exactly matching</em> the column headings as
displayed. By default, it echoes the x and y labels and units from the
original table, but you can change this by clicking on the triangles
below each entry box (e.g., make the label "SNR in WISE-1" rather than
the more cryptic column header "w1snr"). <P>

You can also do simple mathematical manipulations. For example, you
can plot w1mpro vs. w1mpro-w4mpro. Note that you can reverse the axes
such that the brighter objects are at the top of the plot.<br>

<img src="img/plotscreenshot.png" width="100%"><P>

You can add or remove the gridlines via the "Grid" checkbox.  <P>


You can also <strong>restrict what data are plotted</strong> in any of
several different ways. You can set limits based on the "more options"
in the plot options pop-up, or you can use a rubber band zoom, as
follows.  Click and drag in a sub-region of the plot. The icons in the
upper left of the plot change corresponding to what you can do, in
this case to these: <img src="img/plotoptions.png">. They are, from
left to right: zoom in on the region you have selected, select the
objects in the catalog, and filter the catalog to leave only those
objects. If you click on the zoom icon, then the plot axes change to
encompass just the sources you have selected. If you click on the
select icon, then the plot symbols corresponding to your selection
change shape and color, the rows (corresponding to those sources) in
the catalog are highlighted in the catalog window pane, and the
corresponding objects overplotted on the image in the image window
pane change color. If you click on the filter icon, then the catalog
view is filtered down, restricted to just those sources you have
selected, and the filter notes in the upper left of the plot window
(and the upper right of the catalog window) change to remind you that
you have a filter applied. Only those sources that pass the filter are
shown overlaid on the image(s). (This is the behavior of 'filter', as
opposed to 'select'; the former restricts what is shown, the latter
just highlights the objects.) For more on filters, see <a
href="tablesCST.html#filters">the filter section</A>.<P>

If you move your mouse over any of the points, you will get a pop-up
telling you the values corresponding to the point under your cursor.
If you click on any of the points, the object(s) corresponding to that
point will be highlighted in the overlays in the images shown, and
highlighted in the catalog table.  This works the other way too -
click on a row in the catalog, or an object in the images, and the
object will be highlighted in the plot or the catalog or the image.<P>


<strong>Want to save a plot to file?</strong> At this time, the best
way to do that is a screen snapshot. On a Mac, this is accomplished
via holding down command, then shift, then 4, then let go and your
mouse cursor changes. Hit the space bar to select the window over
which your mouse is hovering. Your mouse cursor changes again, and hit
the mouse button. A snapshot is then saved to your Desktop, tagged
with the date and time. <P>


<h3><a name="examples">Example of plotting catalogs</A></h3>

<strong>Example: Plotting [W1] vs. [W1]-[W4] in a star-forming
region</strong><P>

In a star-forming region defined for this example, we expect that the
sources will be dominated by young stars. Stars without circumstellar
dust should be at a variety of W1 brightnesses, but all have
[W1]-[W4]~0.  Background galaxies should be faint and red. Stars with
circumstellar dust (e.g., young stars) should be bright and red. Here,
we will make a plot, identify a bright and red object in the plot,
and find where it is in the WISE images.

<OL>
<LI>In the Catalog Search Tool, start a catalog search. Select
Project=WISE. Select the AllWISE database, and the AllWISE Source
Catalog. Enter a target of IC1396. 
Pick the cone search method and select 0.5 degrees radius.
<LI>It may take a few seconds to load and display the catalog. Note
that all ~17,500 sources are overplotted on the images on the left and
in the plot to the right. The first 100 of the ~17,500 sources are
shown in the bottom table, but you can page through all ~17,500.  
Note that selecting a
source in the image makes its corresponding row in the catalog turn
green and point in the plot turn yellow; this is all interchangable
such that picking a source in one place highlights it in the other
places. 
<LI>The plot comes up with an RA/Dec plot by default. Each point represents
more than one row of the catalog. Mouse over or click on a point to
see how many rows are represented: <img
src="img/morethanonepoint.png">
<LI>Click on the expand (<img src="img/expand-24x24.png">) icon in the
upper right of the plot window to make it big. 
<LI>Click on the gear <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png"> icon in the
upper left of the plot window to change what is plotted.
<LI>Enter in the x box: w1mpro-w4mpro. This is WISE-1 profile-fitted
measurement in magnitudes minus WISE-4 profile-fitted
measurement in magnitudes,or [W1]-[W4]. 
<LI>Click on the triangle next to "X label/unit/options", and enter
"[W1]-[W4]" for the label. Enter "mag" for the unit. Check "grid" to
make the grid appear.
<LI>Enter in the y box: w1mpro  
<LI>Click on the triangle next to "Y label/unit", and enter [W1] for
the label. Enter "mag" for the unit. Click on "reverse" to make the
brighter objects appear at the top of the plot. Click the "grid" box.
<LI>Click "Apply."
<LI>Obtain this plot:<br>
<img src="img/ex1-plot.png" width="100%"><br>
<LI>Note that the points are shades of grey, denoting that
at least one of the points in the plot is representative of more than
one row in the catalog. The legend for how many points correspond to
each shade of grey is given in the upper right.
<LI>Click and drag from corner given approximately by (2,6) to (7,11). 
<LI>The icons in the upper left change after you do this, and we want
to zoom on this region. Click on the magnifying glass with a "+"
inside.
<LI>After we zoom, there are few enough points that individual points
are shown as blue circles. Where they overlap, the blue appears darker.  
<LI>Find the brightest source near [W1]-[W4]~4.5. Click on that point. 
<LI>Click on "Close" in the upper left to return to the window pane
view.
<LI>The (astrophysically) bright and red object we selected in the
plot is highlighted in the overlays on top of the image and in the
catalog (though you may need to scroll in the catalog to find the
green highlighted line). To find it even more easily, you can click
and drag around this point in the plot. Click on the filter icon in
the upper left. The plot at this point looks silly, but only that
point is left in the overlay of sources on the images and in the
catalog list. (If you have been following closely, it should be
J213808.44+572647.6.)
