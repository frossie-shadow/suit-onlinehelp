<h3>IRSA Viewer: Basic Features and Functions </h3>

You can initiate the IRSA Viewer by loading the tool directly, or by
clicking on a link that looks like this: <img
src="img/viewerlaunch.png">. If the you have loaded the tool directly,
the first time you see the IRSA Viewer, it does not have an image
pre-loaded; if you have clicked the icon to launch it, the first time
you see the IRSA Viewer, it already has an image loaded.<P>
The contents of this section essentially follow the menu options for the
IRSA Viewer (e.g., basically the blue tabs across the top, under the
IRSA menu) and major features of the tool in the order in which you
might encounter them.<br> <img src="img/bluetabs.png"><p>


Besides the online help (also available as a pdf), note that there are
also IRSA Viewer Tool and Catalog Search Tool video tutorials,
including  quick start and longer AAS-demo style overviews, available
at the <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIysJbamhNnlu0Bgdrwxn_w"
target="_blank">IRSA YouTube channel</A>.  Also see the IRSA Viewer
playlist (which collects all the IRSA Viewer tutorials together), as
well as the playlist of tutorials relevant for more than one
archive.<P>

<h3><A NAME="searching">Getting Started: Loading Images</A></h3>

When you first start the IRSA Viewer, depending on how you get into
it, either an image is pre-loaded, or the first screen you come to is
a position search for images. If the image is pre-loaded, you can
start manipulating the image right away; see <a
href="visualization.html">the Visualization section</A> below. If,
however, you do not have an image pre-loaded, you will need to select
an image to load.<P>

If you do not have an image pre-loaded, the default start position is
in the position search for images. It is assuming by default that you
want to load an image from IRSA services, though you can also load an
image from disk or off another service on the web (see below).  <P>

The search window looks like this:<br>
<img src="img/search.png" width="100%">
<P>
You can create a new single-color image or a new three-color image.
(More on <a href="#3color">3-color images</A> below.)<P>

Searching is straightforward -- you may enter a target name, and have
either NED-then-Simbad or Simbad-then-NED resolve the target name into
coordinates.  Alternatively, you may enter coordinates directly. These
coordinates can be in decimal degrees or in hh:mm:ss dd:mm:ss format.
By default, it assumes you are working in J2000 coordinates; you can
also specify galactic, ecliptic, or B1950 coordinates as follows:
<UL>
<LI>'46.53, -0.251 gal' means 46.53, -0.251 degrees in galactic coordinates
<LI>'12.7, +4.3 ecl' means 12.7, +4.3 degrees in ecliptic coordinates
<LI>'19h17m 11d58m b1950' means 19h17m 11d58m in B1950 coordinates 
</UL>
Examples are given below the text entry box before you start typing in
the box.<P>

As you are completing a valid coordinate entry, it echoes back to
you what it thinks you are entering. Look right below the box in which
you are typing the coordinates to see it dynamically change.  <P>

The next row of the initial screen has a series of tabs from which you
can select <strong>images from any of a number of surveys</strong>,
mostly from IRSA: IRAS, 2MASS, WISE, MSX, DSS, and SDSS. Selecting any of
those tabs changes the options immediately below the tabs to allow you
to select a bandpass (wavelength). <P>

To <strong>instead select an image off of your local disk</strong>,
select the tab marked 'FITS file', and then tell it where to find the
image on your local disk. To load an <strong>image from the
web</strong>, pick the 'URL' tab and enter the URL from which you want
an image loaded. In these cases, the image size options vanish (as,
for that matter, does the target input box) because they are no longer
relevant.<P>

Below the box where you select survey and wavelength, you can
then specify the size of the images you want.  You may enter the
radius in arcseconds, arcminutes, or degrees; just change the pulldown
option accordingly. <strong>Caution:</strong> pick your units from the
pulldown first, and then enter a number; if you enter a number and
then select from the pulldown, it will convert your number from the
old units to the new units. There are both upper and lower limits to
your search radius; it will tell you if you request something too big
or too small. Note that these limits are image-dependent; larger
images are available from certain surveys and smaller images are
available from other surveys. <P>


To actually complete the task as requested, choose the "Search" button
in the lower left.<P>

Additional images can be added after an initial search by clicking on
the blue "Images" tab (which also looks like a button) near the top
left. The resulting window resembles the initial search window.  You
can use the same target as before, or change the target. To close the
search window without getting a new image, click on "cancel".<P>

Once any image appears in your browser window, let your mouse
hover any portion of the image. Details about the image and the
portion of the image under your mouse cursor appear in the upper
right:<br>
<img src="img/pixelreadout.png"><P>

To remove an image you have already loaded, click on the small blue
"x" in the upper right of the corresponding image tile.<P>


<h3><A NAME="3-color">Making 3-color Images</A></h3>

You can create 3-color images directly from the image search screen.
Select "Create New Plot - 3 colors" from the top row of options. The
rest of the pop-up changes to look like the following:<br>
<img src="img/3colors.png" width="100%"><P>
By default, you can select the red plane first; you can click on the
arrows on the left hand side of each color bar to expand the options
for those planes, as follows:<br>
<img src="img/3colors2.png" width="100%"><p>

It assumes that you must want the same position for all three color
planes.<P>

It pre-fills the image size with the largest available for the surveys
you have selected. You can change this, and it will warn you if you
select a size that is too big or too small.<P>

Select your options, and click 'Search' in the lower left. Click
'Cancel' to, well, cancel.<P>

To change the color stretch of each color plane individually, click on
the "Color Stretch" icon in the toolbox on the top of the
IRSA Viewer window; see the <a href="visualization.html">Visualization
section</A>.<P>

<strong>Caution:</strong> The images will be downsampled to the
resolution of the red image. If you, say, load an IRAS image into the
red plane, a WISE image into the green plane, and a 2MASS image into
the blue plane, all of the images will have IRAS-sized pixels. If you
load a WISE image into the red and green planes, and a 2MASS images
into the blue plane, the images will have WISE-sized pixels.<P> 


<h3><A NAME="help">Getting Help</A></h3>

The "Help" blue tab leads you into this online help. There are also
context-sensitive help markers throughout the tools (<img
src="img/help.png">). You can also download a PDF version of this
manual; look at the top of the help window for the "View PDF" link.<P>

You can submit questions to the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk</A>.<P>

A set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the IRSA Viewer is <a
href="faq.html">here</A>. <p>

<a name="bugs"></A><strong>Found a bug?</strong> The known bugs and
issues in this version of the IRSA Viewer are listed <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/known_issues/irsaviewerbugslist.html"
target="_blank">here</A>.  If you think you have found a bug, before
reporting it, please check this list, and read this online IRSA Viewer
help. It may be a "feature" we already know about.  If you have found
a new, real bug, then please do contact us via the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Helpdesk"
target="_blank">IRSA Help Desk</A>. Please include your operating
system version and your browser software and version.  If you can,
please also include any specific error message you may have gotten.
(NB: In our testing, copying shortcuts worked on Windows and Linux;
the command-C did not work on Macs, but selecting and clicking the
right mouse button did.)<P>



<h3><A NAME="catalogs">Catalogs -- Retrieving and using catalogs</A></h3>

You can choose from any of a wide variety of catalogs (from IRSA or
your own disk) to load and overlay on your <a
href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>. For lots more
information, please see the <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs
section</A>.<P>

Start a catalog search by clicking on the blue 'Catalog' tab (which
also looks like a button) near the upper left. The basic search
parameters (position, type of search and parameters like radius)
appear in the upper right.  By default, the catalog search comes up
with the last target searched.  In the upper left, you can select a 
project (e.g., 2mASS) and category (e.g., 2MASS All-Sky Release
Database) and
catalog (e.g., 2MASS All-Sky Point Source Catalog). <P>
<img src="img/catalogsearch.png" width="100%"><P>

To change catalogs, first select the "project" under which they are
housed at IRSA, such as 2MASS, IRAS, WISE, MSX, etc.  The available
choices under the "category" and the specific clickable catalog change
according to the project you have selected.  A short description is
provided for each of the catalogs, with links for more information
(including definitions of the sometimes cryptic column names); an
example is here:<br> <img src="img/catalogcoldef.png"><P>

If you want to impose additional constraints on the catalog at this
point (e.g., SNR &gt; n in some band), you may place constraints at
this point. However, be advised that it is easy to combine constraints
such that no sources are retrieved!<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search. <P>

<b>NOTE THAT</b> the search may take a long time to return, especially
if you have asked for a large catalog, and you may think that nothing
has happened... but be patient, and eventually it will 
return a tab.<P>

Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take more time.<P>

Once you have a catalog loaded, there is a window pane (on the right)
with the catalog itself, as well as a window pane (at the bottom) with
a plot made from the catalog. You can change what is plotted; see the <a
href="catalogs.html#xyplots">Catalogs section</A>. The image you
originally loaded is on the left, and the sources from the catalog you
have loaded are overplotted on the image.<P>

For lots more information, please see the <a href="catalogs.html">Catalogs
section</A>.<P>
