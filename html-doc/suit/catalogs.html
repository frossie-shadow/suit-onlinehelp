<h3>IRSA Viewer: Catalogs</h3>

You can choose from any of a wide variety of catalogs to load for
overlaying on your <a href="visualization.html">visualized data</A>.
The catalog search is happier overall if you have performed at least
one search, e.g., you have something on which to overlay the catalog.

<h3><a name="irsacatalogs">Catalogs from IRSA</A></h3>

By clicking on the blue "Catalog" tab (which also looks like a
button), a window appears with several options, as follows.  <P>

<img src="img/catalogsearch.png" width="100%"><P>

The upper left of this window is where you specify which catalog you
want to search.  To change catalogs, first select the "project" under
which they are housed at IRSA, such as 2MASS, IRAS, WISE, MSX, etc. 
The available choices under the "category" and the specific clickable
catalog change according to the project you have selected.  A short
description is provided for each of the catalogs, with links for more
information (including definitions of the sometimes cryptic column
names); an example is here:<br> <img src="img/catalogcoldef.png"><P>

The upper right of this window is where you specify the target (the
position is pre-filled with its best guess as to what you want) and
the search method (cone, elliptical, box, polygon, multi-object,
all-sky), and the parameters that go with that search method (e.g.,
the radius of the cone).  <P>

<strong>Caution</strong>: pick your units from the pulldown first, and
then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select from the
pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to the new
units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search radius; it
will tell you if you request something too big or too small. Note that
these limits are survey-dependent.   <P>

The bottom of this window allows you to set restrictions on specific
columns. It gives you a list of all the available column names in the
corresponding catalog. (Most catalogs have identical "standard" and
"long form" but some have more columns available in "long form".) From
here, you can choose what to display (tickboxes on the left), and
filter what is returned ("constraints" column). For
example, only return objects with values in column y that are greater
than x. If you add more than one restriction, they are combined
logically using an "AND" operators; be careful, because you can thus
restrict data such that none of the catalog meets your criteria.<P>

Click on "Search" to initiate the search. It will load the catalog
into a tab of its own. The objects will also be overlaid on any images
you have loaded, and a default x-y plot will be shown. (For more on the
x-y plots, see <a href="#xyplots">below</A>.)  All of these
representations are interlinked -- clicking on a row in the table
shows it on the image and in the plot, and clicking on an object in
the image shows it in the table and in the plot, and clicking on an
object in the plot shows it in the table and on the image.<P>

To close the catalog search window without searching for a catalog,
click on "Cancel".<P>

<dl><dt><strong>On the speed of the catalog results...</strong><P>

<dd>If the catalog search is successful quickly, it will promptly return
the results in a tab of its own. <P> 

<b>NOTE THAT</b> the search may take a long time to return, especially
if you have asked for a large catalog, and you may think that nothing
has happened, but be patient and eventually it will 
return a tab.<P>

Use large search radii with caution! Be sure you understand how many
sources you are likely to retrieve. Searches that retrieve more rows
will take longer. Searches that retrieve millions of rows will take
quite a while. <P>

</dl>

If you overlay a catalog consisting of tens of thousands of sources,
then turn around and <a
href="visualization.html#fitsDownloadOptions">save a regions file from
the catalog overlay</A>, then you will end up with fewer sources in
the regions file than you have in the full catalog.<P>



<h3><a name="owncatalogs">Loading your own catalogs</A></h3><P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you can
pick another tab from the top center, "Load Catalog", to load your own
catalog.<P>

Your catalog needs to be in <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table format</A>, which is a varietal of plain
text. IRSA has a <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/TblValidator/"
target="_blank">table reformatting and validation service</A> which
may be helpful, or you can download just about any catalog you find
through IRSA, and mimic that format.<P>

Your table file MUST have RA and Dec values, and unless it is
specified, it assumes J2000.<P>

You can add a "SYMBOL" parameter to change the shape
(X, SQUARE, CROSS, EMP_CROSS, DIAMOND, DOT) of catalog marks, e.g.:
<pre>
\SYMBOL = X
</pre>
<P>

You can add a "DEFAULT_COLOR" parameter to assign a CSS color name or
a HEX value to catalog marks, e.g., either of these two:
<pre>
\DEFAULT_COLOR = lightcyan
\DEFAULT_COLOR = #00FF00
</pre>
You can find the <a
href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp"
target="_blank">CSS color code</A> or the <a 
href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colorsfull.asp"
target="_blank">CSS color HEX values</A> online.<P> 


<h3><A name="vocatalogs">Catalogs from the VO</A> -- Overlaying
catalogs obtained via the VO</h3>

(VO= <A href="http://www.virtualobservatory.org/" target="_blank">Virtual
Observatory</A>.)<P>

By clicking on the blue "Catalogs" tab, you are by default dropped
into the interface for searching for catalogs at IRSA. However, you
can pick another tab from the center right, "VO Catalog", to search for
and load  catalogs from the VO.<P>

<br><img src="img/vocatalogs.png" width="100%"><br>
<P>

As for the IRSA catalog search, the tool pre-fills the target position with
the coordinates of the target with which you have been working. In
this case, you are limited to a cone search, so the next option is the
cone search radius. As usual, pick your units from the pulldown first,
and then enter a number; if you enter a number and then select from
the pulldown, it will convert your number from the old units to the
new units. There are both upper and lower limits to your search
radius; it will tell you if you request something too big or too
small. <P>

Now, you need to put in the URL of the VO-compliant search that you
want to use.  If you know your VO URL already, type or paste your URL
into the box and hit search.<P>

More commonly, however, users do not know <em>a priori</em> which URL
to use. Click on the "Find Astronomical Data Resources" link, which
will open another browser tab or window with a searchable NAVO
registry. Search on your desired keywords. Sift through the results to
find what you want. Click on "Full Record" to view the full record of
that resource in the registry. Look for "simple cone search" (near the
bottom of the record), and copy the URL listed under "Available
endpoints for the standard interface". Paste that into the IRSA Viewer
cone search URL box.  Click on "Search" to initiate the search. <P>

The search results are then shown (and interacted with) in the same way as
the other catalogs described here.<P>

<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: Note that searching the VO means
that you are using resources not specifically housed at IRSA, so
servers may be down, or timeouts set, or limits on numbers of returned
sources, etc., that are beyond our control. In most cases the solution
is to specify as precise a search as possible.  The URL you enter into
the box in FinderChart, though, must be a Cone Search base URL (not
containing RA and Dec parameters, which are inserted into the URL by
FinderChart in response to the search parameters you give it).<P>

<strong>Example</strong>: Search on IC1396 and get a WISE image.
Search in the NAVO registry for "IPHAS". Obtain the "IPHAS DR2 Source
Catalog. Go down to "Simple cone search" and expand it by clicking on
the [+] on the left. Obtain this URL, which is found under "Available
endpoints for the standard interface":<br>
http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/votable/-A?-out.all&-source=II%2F321%2Fiphas2&<br>
Copy this into the IRSA Viewer VO search URL. Click search. Obtain
rows from the IPHAS catalog in the IRSA Viewer interface.<P>





<h3><A name="columnsfilters">Columns and filters</A> -- Interacting
with catalogs</h3>

After you have loaded a catalog, it appears as an additional tab on
the right hand side; all the catalogs you choose to load will be in
the catalog window pane, one tab per catalog. The objects will also be
overlaid on any images you have loaded, and a default x-y plot will be
shown (for more on the x-y plots, see <a href="#xyplots">below</A>).
All of these representations are interlinked -- clicking on a row in
the table shows it on the image and in the plot, and clicking on an
object in the image shows it in the table and in the plot, and
clicking on an object in the plot shows it in the table and on the
image.<P>


To see more of the columns (and see more of the options described
shortly below), grab the divider(s) between the window panes and slide
it to widen the catalog pane until you can see the icon that looks
like this: <img src="img/tableoptions.png">.<P>

The table is shown exactly as it appears in the database (or as it
appeared on your disk), with all columns as defined for that catalog.
To understand what each column is, please see the documentation
associated with that catalog (available via the catalog searching
popup window shown above, or by navigating through the IRSA
website.)<P>

The tab (and table) name itself is the name of the catalog file as
stored on the system at IRSA; it may be a little cryptic, but the first
few words should make it clear whether it is WISE, 2MASS, etc. To
remove the tab, click on the blue "X".<P>

Immediately below the tab name(s), there are several symbols:<br> <img
src="img/tablehead.png"><br> which we now describe.<P>

The first thing to notice is that only the first 100 rows of the
retrieved catalog are displayed in the table. In the example, there
are 589 sources that were retrieved as part of the search.  The black
arrows plus the page number allow you to navigate among these 'pages'
of 100 sources each.  Note that the entire set of results (not just
the 100 rows you are currently viewing) can be sorted alphabetically
(or numerically for number fields) by clicking on any column's name.
(Note also that in the plotting and overlay features described below,
all the sources in the catalog are plotted on the images you have, not
just the 100 shown in the first page.)<P>

Going from left to right along the top of the catalog tab, the next
icon represents a filter: <img src="img/filter.png"> Filters are a
<em>very</em> powerful way of exploring the catalog data.  Click on
this icon in order to start the process of adding filters. A text
entry box appears above each of the current catalog columns, with a
small version of the filter icon corresponding to that row on the far
left. You can type operators and values in these boxes -- hit return
after typing or click in another box to implement the filter. For
fields with a limited set of choices, instead of a text entry box, a
filter icon will appear; click on it to select from the available
choices. As an example, to show only those sources with declination
above a certain value (say, 31 degrees), type "&gt; 31" in the box
above the "dec" column. Or, if you have retrieved a WISE catalog and
would like to only view the objects with a W1 (3.4 micron)
profile-fitted magnitude less than 6 magnitudes, above the 'w1mpro'
column, type "&lt; 6" in the form.  <P>

After you impose a filter, then the number of rows in the catalog is
restricted according to the rules you have specified, and the
"filters" icon on the top right of the catalog pane has changed to
remind you that there has been a filter applied, in this case just one
filter: <img src="img/filtersapplied.png">. To clear the filters, click on
the cancel filters icon (which also appears after you impose filters):
<img src="img/cancelfilters.png">.<P>

Note that the filters are logically "AND"ed together -- it will impose
this AND that AND this other restriction. You can relatively easily
restrict things such that no data are left; if that is the case, you
will get "There are no data to display." You can then cancel all the
filters at once via the cancel filters icon (<img
src="img/cancelfilters.png">), or remove them individually by hand by
editing the filter boxes at the top of each column, just as you did to
impose the filters. <P>

The available logical operators are :
<UL>
<LI> =  which means 'equal to' (exactly!), e.g., the parameter on
which you are querying (the column headers as shown) is exactly equal to
this value you are specifying.
<LI> &gt; which means 'greater than'
<LI> &lt; which mean 'less than'
<LI> != which means 'not equal to' (exactly!)
<LI> &gt;= which means 'greater than or equal to'
<LI> &lt;= which means 'less than or equal to'
<LI> IN which means 'included within this list', e.g., the
parameter  on which you are querying (such as "Bandpass") is included
within the list you are specifying (if the column filter is free-form
text, type "value1,value2" and it will give you rows that have value1
or value2).
<LI> LIKE which means 'resembles the text that is entered', e.g., the text
resembles the text that you type in the box.
</UL>



The next icon is <img src="img/texttable.png"> -- clicking on this
changes the table display into a text display. The icon then changes
to <img src="img/table.png"> -- click this again to return to the
default table view.<P>

The next icon is <img src="img/savetable.png"> which is "Save" -- this
is how you may save the catalog to your own local disk. It will save
it as an <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/DDGEN/Doc/ipac_tbl.html"
target="_blank">IPAC table file</A>, which is basically ASCII text
with headers explaining the type of data in  each column, separated by
vertical bars.  By default, the file is called "GatorQuery.tbl"
because, under the hood, the software is talking to the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/"
target="_blank">IRSA Catalog Search Tool</A>, powered by Gator.
<strong>Note that</strong> it will save your whole catalog if you save
without filtering. If you filter, the header of the file will still
say that all the rows are included, but only the filtered-down rows
are saved.<P>


The next to last option on the top of the catalog tab is this: <img
src="img/tableoptions.png">.  Clicking on this icon brings up options
for the table:<br>
<img src="img/tableoptionspopup.png"><br>
From here, you can change:
<UL>
<LI>Whether units are shown at the tops of the columns.
<LI>Whether or not the filters are shown at the tops of the columns
(same as clicking on the filter icon).
<LI>How many rows are displayed per page. (Note that expanding the
page size to numbers much greater than 100 may result in a substantial
performance degradation -- e.g., your browser will appear to freeze or
not appear to be doing anything while it manages and renders the large
table.)  
<LI>Which columns are shown (tickboxes on the left of each row). 
By default, all columns are shown. To select all of them at once,
click on the tickbox at the top of the column.
</UL>
From this pop-up, you can also see the description of each field in
the database (note that you can scroll right to see them all), and
impose filters just like at the top of the columns. The set of all the
imposed filters is collected at the bottom of this window (in the
"Filters" box). Remember that the filters are "AND"ed together.<P>

This is the last option on the top of the catalog tab: <img
src="img/expand-24x24.png">. Clicking on this expands the catalog
window pane to take up the entire browser window. To return to the
prior view, click on "Close" in the upper left.<P>


You can also interactively impose filters from <a
href="#xyplots">plots you make</A> from the catalog - see the next
section for discussion.<P>

<strong>Power user tip:</strong> If you impose filters from the plot
(see next section), it manifests as four filters on the catalog, one
for each side of the square you have drawn on the plot. If you want to
remove, say, just one of the four filters (rather than all of them by
cancelling all filters), you can do so from the table options pop-up.


<h3><a name="xyplots">Plotting catalogs</A></h3>

You can plot your catalog after it has loaded. By default, the plots
appear on the bottom of the browser window, in their own window pane.
The plot, the image, and the catalog are all interlinked -- clicking
on a row in the table shows it on the image and in the plot, and
clicking on an object in the image shows it in the table and in the
plot, and clicking on an object in the plot shows it in the table and
on the image.<P>

To obtain a full-screen view of your plot, click on the expand icon in
the upper right of the window pane when your mouse is in the window:
<img src="img/expand-24x24.png">. To return to the prior view, click
the "Close" arrow in the upper left.<P>

The plotting tool, by default, starts with RA and Dec plotted. Note
that now (as of 10/2016) it does so following astronomical convention
-- RA increases to the left.  <P>

<strong>Plot format: a first look</strong><P>

If you have loaded a catalog with many points, you may have an RA/Dec
plot that looks like the one on the left here. If you have loded a
catalog with few points, you will have an RA/Dec plot that looks like
the one on the right here.<br>
<img src="img/defaultradecbinned.png" width="50%"><img
src="img/defaultradecunbinned.png" width="50%"><P>

The difference between them is that, for large catalogs (left), the plot is
binned -- more points are encompassed in a black tile and fewer points
are encompassed in a white tile. For small catalogs (right), each
individual point is shown as a blue dot.<P>

In either case, letting your mouse hover over a point tells you the
values of the point under your cursor, and (if binned) how many points
are represented:<br>
<img src="img/morethanonepoint.png"><P>


<strong>Changing what is plotted</strong><P>

To change what is plotted, click on the gears icon in the upper right
of the plot window pane: <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png"
align="center">. Configuration options then appear:<br> <img
src="img/plotoptionspopup.png"><br>

Here, you can specify what should be plotted on each axis. The "Cols"
link will bring up a table that lists all of the available columns in
the catalog. Alternatively, you can just start typing, and viable
options appear below the box. Whatever you put in the box must match
the column name as shown in the catalog <em>exactly</em>. It<P>

In this example, RA is plotted. It has pulled the column
name for the label; in this table, the column is "ra" rather than
"RA". It has copied over the units ("deg") from the catalog. You can
change what column is plotted, as well as what label and units are
shown in the plot. Next, you can choose whether or not a grid is
included on that axis, and whether or not the axis is reversed -- in
this case, because it's plotting RA, the axis is reversed. Next in the
pop-up are the identical options for the y-axis. Click on the triangle
to open these options for the y-axis.  <P>

By default, the boundaries of the plot are set to encompass the full
data range. Here you can change the boundaries to specific numbers.
(This can also be set via filtering from the plot; see below.)<P>

If you want a square or rectangular plot, you can change the x/y ratio
as displayed.<P>

Finally, you can control how the plot is binning up points for the
greyscale plots. You can control how many bins are used, and how the
grey shading is calculated (linearly or logarithmically). <P>

Click "Apply" to apply, "Clear" to clear all fields, and "Reset" to
set it back to default values.<P>

Example: Load a WISE catalog. Plot w1snr vs. w1mpro. Change the labels
by clicking on the triangles below each entry box, and make the label
"SNR in WISE-1" rather than the more cryptic column header "w1snr".<P>

<strong>Plotting manipulated columns</strong><P>

You can choose a single column to plot against another column, as
above. However, you can also do simple mathematical manipulations.<P>

For example, if you have loaded a WISE catalog, you can plot [W1] vs.
[W1]-[W4]. In terms of the names of the columns in the database, this
is w1mpro vs. w1mpro-w4mpro.  <br>

<img src="img/plotscreenshot.png" width="100%"><P>


<strong>Restricting what is plotted</strong><P>


You can also restrict what data are plotted in any of several
different ways. <P>

You can set limits from the plot options pop-up (discussed above).<P>

However, and perhaps more powerfully, you can set limits from the plot
itself using a rubber band zoom.  Click and drag in a sub-region of
the plot. The icons in the upper left of the plot change
corresponding to what you can do, in this case to these: <img
src="img/plotoptions.png">. They are, from left to right: zoom in on
the region you have selected, select the objects in the catalog, and
filter the catalog to leave only those objects. If you click on the
zoom icon, then the plot axes change to encompass just the sources you
have selected. (Click on the 1x icon <img src="img/onex.png"> to
return to the original view.)
If you click on the select icon, then the plot symbols
corresponding to your selection change shape and color, the rows
(corresponding to those sources) in the catalog are highlighted in the
catalog window pane, and the corresponding objects overplotted on the
image in the image window pane change color. If you click on the
filter icon, then the catalog view is filtered down, restricted to
just those sources you have selected, and the filter notes in the
upper left of the plot window (and the upper right of the catalog
window) change to remind you that you have a filter applied. Only
those sources that pass the filter are shown overlaid on the image(s).
(This is the behavior of 'filter', as opposed to 'select'; the former
restricts what is shown, the latter just highlights the objects.) For
more on filters, see <a href="#filters">the filter section</A>.<P>

If you have a big catalog, zooming or filtering may mean
that then individual points can be shown, rather than binned
points.<P>

If you move your mouse over any of the points, you will get a pop-up
telling you the values corresponding to the point under your cursor.
If you click on any of the points, the object(s) corresponding to that
point will be highlighted in the overlays in the images shown, and
highlighted in the catalog table.  This works the other way too -
click on a row in the catalog, or an object in the images, and the
object will be highlighted in the plot or the catalog or the image.<P>

<strong>Want to save a plot to file?</strong> At this time, the best
way to do that is a screen snapshot. On a Mac, this is accomplished
via holding down command, then shift, then 4, then let go and your
mouse cursor changes. Hit the space bar to select the window over
which your mouse is hovering. Your mouse cursor changes again, and hit
the mouse button. A snapshot is then saved to your Desktop, tagged
with the date and time. <P>


<h3><a name="examples">Examples of catalog plots</A></h3>

<strong>Example: Plotting [W1] vs. [W1]-[W4] in a star-forming
region</strong><P>

In a star-forming region defined for this example, we are trying to
find young stars. We will search in the WISE AllWISE catalog. Stars
without circumstellar dust should be at a variety of W1 brightnesses,
but all have [W1]-[W4]~0.  Background galaxies should be faint and
red. Stars with circumstellar dust (e.g., young stars) should be
bright and red. Here, we will make a plot, identify a bright and red
object in the plot, and find where it is in the WISE images.

<OL>
<LI>Launch the IRSA Viewer tool however you wish. Click on "Images." 
Select "Create New Plot". Enter target as IC1396. Use Simbad's
interpretation of the coordinates. Click on the WISE tab. Select
4-band Atlas. Select Band 1.  Select image size of 1 degree. Click
'Search.'
<LI>Load the other 3 WISE bands by repeating the sequence 3 times:
Click on "Images"; select "Create New Plot"; select the next WISE band
in the sequence; click 'Search.'
<LI>Click on the blue "catalogs" tab. Select Project=WISE. Select the
AllWISE database, and the AllWISE Source Catalog. Leave the cone
search method and target as what it comes set up with as the default -
it is set to the target we just used for our search. However, make
sure to change the units of the pulldown to "deg" and enter 0.5 degree
in the cone radius to match the images. Leave all the defaults in the
Table Selection section. Click "Search."  You may have to wait a bit
for the catalog to be returned. 
<LI>Now the catalog is loaded in the upper right, overplotted on the
image in the upper left, and plotted as an x-y plot on the bottom. Note
that all ~17,500 sources are overplotted on the images to the left of
the catalog and in the plot below the catalog, but only the first 100
are shown in the catalog in the upper right (though all are loaded). 
Note that selecting a source in the image makes its corresponding row
in the catalog turn green and point in the plot turn yellow; this is
all interchangable such that picking a source in one place highlights
it in the other places. (In the image, your search target is a blue
circle, the selected source in the image is a default blue square with
an x in it. You may have to view just one image at a time and click on
the 'zoom to fit' icon to see your selected source in the image.)
<LI>The plot comes up with an RA/Dec plot by default. Each point represents
more than one row of the catalog. Mouse over or click on a point to
see how many rows are represented: <img
src="img/morethanonepoint.png">
<LI>Click on the expand (<img src="img/expand-24x24.png">) icon in the
upper right of the plot window to make it big. 
<LI>Click on the gear <img src="img/xyplotoptions.png"> icon in the
upper left of the plot window to change what is plotted.
<LI>Enter in the x box: w1mpro-w4mpro. This is WISE-1 profile-fitted
measurement in magnitudes minus WISE-4 profile-fitted
measurement in magnitudes,or [W1]-[W4]. 
<LI>Click on the triangle next to "X label/unit/options", and enter
"[W1]-[W4]" for the label. Enter "mag" for the unit. Check "grid" to
make the grid appear.
<LI>Enter in the y box: w1mpro  
<LI>Click on the triangle next to "Y label/unit", and enter [W1] for
the label. Enter "mag" for the unit. Click on "reverse" to make the
brighter objects appear at the top of the plot. Click the "grid" box.
<LI>Click "Apply."
<LI>Obtain this plot:<br>
<img src="img/ex1-plot.png" width="100%"><br>
<LI>Note that the points are shades of grey, denoting that
at least one of the points in the plot is representative of more than
one row in the catalog. The legend for how many points correspond to
each shade of grey is given in the upper right.
<LI>Click and drag from corner given approximately by (2,6) to (7,11). 
<LI>The icons in the upper left change after you do this, and we want
to zoom on this region. Click on the magnifying glass with a "+"
inside.
<LI>After we zoom, there are few enough points that individual points
are shown as blue circles. Where they overlap, the blue appears darker.  
<LI>Find the brightest source near [W1]-[W4]~4.5. Click on that point. 
<LI>Click on "Close" in the upper left to return to the window pane
view.
<LI>The (astrophysically) bright and red object we selected in the
plot is highlighted in the overlays on top of the image and in the
catalog (though you may need to scroll in the catalog to find the
green highlighted line). To find it even more easily, you can click
and drag around this point in the plot. Click on the filter icon in
