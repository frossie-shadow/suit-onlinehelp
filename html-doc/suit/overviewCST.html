<h3>Catalog Search Tool: Overview</h3>

This abbreviated documentation describes just the tables, images, and
x-y plots that are part of the Catalog Search Tool.  There is
additional, <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/GatorAid/irsa/QuickGuidetoGator.htm">different
documentation</A> elsewhere for <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Gator/">the Catalog
Search Tool</A> as a whole. <P>

There is also a standalone version of the <a
href="http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/irsaviewer/">IRSA Viewer</A>, which
has more functionality, such as searching within the application. 
The IRSA Viewer documentation is the first half of this online
documentation.<P>



<h3>Visualization</h3>

The images loaded into the visualizer appear in a 'window pane' in the
top left of the results of your catalog search. <P> 

See <a href="visualizationCST.html">the visualization section</A> for more
on visualization.<P>

<h3>Tables</h3>

Search results appear in an interactive table
of results. These tables can be sorted and filtered. 
See <a href="tablesVST.html">the tables section</A> for more on
tables.<P>


<h3>X-Y Plots</h3>

You can make x-y plots from your catalog search results.  See <a
href="xyplotsCST.html">the x-y plots section</A> for more on catalogs.<P>
